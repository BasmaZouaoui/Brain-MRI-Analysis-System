# Brain MRI Analysis System

An AI-powered system for brain tumor detection using the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture.
This project includes both **model training** and a **clinical web interface** for analyzing brain MRI scans.

---

## Overview

This system uses a fine-tuned Vision Transformer model to classify brain MRI images into four categories:

* **Glioma** ‚Äì Aggressive brain tumors requiring urgent attention
* **Meningioma** ‚Äì Typically benign, slow-growing tumors
* **Pituitary Adenoma** ‚Äì Tumors affecting hormone production
* **No Tumor** ‚Äì Normal healthy brain tissue

## Features

### Dataset

This project uses the publicly available **Brain Tumor MRI dataset** on Kaggle:
üîó [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

### Model Training (`finetuning_vit.ipynb`)

* Fine-tunes Vision Transformer on the MRI dataset
* Stratified data splitting (train/validation/test)
* Real-time metrics tracking and visualization
* Confusion matrix and classification reports
* Attention visualization for model interpretability

### Clinical Interface (`app.py`)

* Professional medical-style interface
* Upload MRI scans for analysis
* Confidence scores for each tumor type
* Visual explanation using attention maps
* Downloadable clinical analysis reports
* Built-in disclaimers and safety warnings

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BasmaZouaoui/Brain-MRI-Analysis-System.git
cd Brain-MRI-Analysis-System
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers streamlit
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
pip install plotly opencv-python pillow huggingface-hub
```

---

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle.
2. **Set training parameters** in the notebook:

   ```python
   MODEL_NAME = "google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k"
   DATA_DIR = "/path/to/brain-tumor-mri-dataset"
   OUTPUT_DIR = "./vit-brain-tumor-classifier"
   ```
3. **Run all cells** in `finetuning_vit.ipynb`.

### Running the Clinical Interface

1. Update the model path in `app.py`.
2. Start the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser at **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)** to use the interface.
